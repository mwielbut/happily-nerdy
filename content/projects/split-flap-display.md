A custom-built split flap display project exploring mechanical displays and microcontroller programming.

## The Project

Split flap displays are the classic mechanical displays you'd see in train stations and airports before digital screens took over. There's something deeply satisfying about the sound and motion of the flaps rotating to reveal new information.

## What I Learned

Building this taught me about:

- Stepper motor control and timing
- Mechanical design and 3D printing
- Electronics integration with microcontrollers
- The joy of physical computing projects
