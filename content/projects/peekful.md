Peekful was a semantic business search platform that aimed to make finding and understanding businesses more intuitive.

## The Concept

Traditional business search relies on keywords and categories. Peekful explored a different approach: understanding what businesses actually do and matching that with what people are looking for.

## Technical Challenges

- Natural language processing for business descriptions
- Building semantic search at scale
- Balancing precision with recall in search results
